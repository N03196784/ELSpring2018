Project: Multiple Sensor Deployment Package

Work Done so far:    ----Collected parts----

Work that needs to be done in the next 3 week:   
1. Make sure all sensors are working
2. Make sure all pi's are recording data in real time and uploading to google sheet
3. Possibly have a special case to put the pi and sensors in
4. Make the pi's all be able to upload to website
5. Make sure website is user friendly and looking clean
6. Bug test site
									
									
I Jonathan Bing have the roll of figuring out how to get the sensor's to upload their data to google's "sheets" program so that we can take that data and put it 
onto the site where it needs to be. I have to make sure all the sensors are working and generating realistic outputs. Once all the PIs' are uploading correctly
the next step is seamlessly transferring the data into user friendly table. A big piece of this puzzle is making it so that we can add pis to the collection easily
and quickly without having to do much more than copying the code from the first pis.
